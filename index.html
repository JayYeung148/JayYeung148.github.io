<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in Linguistics</strong>, focusing mainly on syntax and computational linguistics, with my dissertation written on <a href="https://jayyeung.com/resources/Jay_dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">improving synthetic speech intelligibility</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I will be working as an associate at <a href="https://bcg.com" target="_blank">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a></strong>, helping large corporations and governments solve strategic and operational problems around the globe, from growth strategy and restructuring to market research and business analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am currently working on multiple projects</strong>, from building a virtual race engineer for racing drivers to a SaaS for GP surgeries in the UK. Learn more in the &ldquo;Current projects&rdquo; section below.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="-current-projects">üë®‚Äçüíª Current projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chronos</strong> brings Formula-1-like racing data to amateur racing drivers. Through a smartphone app, drivers can see crucial racing data such as laptimes, laptime deltas, race position, and gaps to other drivers on their own smartphone screens. Not only that, Chronos can also act as a virtual race engineer, giving situation-specific data and answering drivers&rsquo; questions over voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>eTriage</strong> aims to automate the patient triage process of GP surgeries in the UK, saving doctors and surgeries hours every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sinodem</strong>, a think-tank and lobby group for the successful and sustainable democratization of mainland China.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-past-experience">üìú Past experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Last summer, I worked at BCG as a strategy consulting intern</strong>, where I was staffed on a restructuring and turnaround project for one of the largest multinational automakers in the world.  My direct responsibility was to create a dashboard for the board of directors to track the progress of a ¬£100m+ cost-cutting program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I founded and sold <a href="https://tomorrowsci.com" target="_blank">Tomorrow Science</a></strong>, a Chinese language popular science website that has 140,000+ followers on social media, 300,000+ monthly page views, and 5 employees. The goal of Tomorrow Science is to help readers envision the world of tomorrow through the latest scientific, technological, and medical news. In May 2020, Tomorrow Science was sold to 2 Taiwanese investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I founded <a href="https://clearcall.app" target="_blank">Clearcall</a> with Justin Glibert and Florian M√ºller</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve won a number of business case competitions and hackathons</strong>:</p>

<h2 id="-fun-things-about-me">‚õÑ Fun things about me</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I never went to high school.</strong> When I was 12 years old, I left my native Hong Kong and spent 2 years at Plum Village, a Zen Buddhist monastery in France, to study under Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. Changing my mind last-minute about becoming a monk, I spent my pre-university years studying French and Spanish at language schools in Lyon, Barcelona, and Salamanca.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I can speak 5 languages</strong>. As a result of my pre-university journey, I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish fluently and French at an intermediate level. I self studied for the British A-levels and ultimately chose to study linguistics at Edinburgh University.</p>
